# 2020GameJam
A game I made for the Fall 2020 MST Game Jam. I am not much of a visual artist, so a friend helped me with almost all the art and assets. 

Looking at it now there is plenty I would do differently, but this is the first time I realized that I could learn how to use totally new programs/programming languages very quickly. In the two week timespan of the gamejam, I both learned how to use Game Maker Studio and made this game.
